# BetterLearn

## Overview

BetterLearn is a learning app designed to help people learn efficiently using spaced repetition and quick, adaptive AI-generated tests. The app leverages AI to generate flashcards and quizzes, and uses proven spaced repetition techniques to maximize retention.

## Problem: How do we learn? 

### The Science Behind BetterLearn

Most people forget new information quickly after learning it‚Äîa phenomenon described by the "forgetting curve," first studied by psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus in the late 19th century. The forgetting curve shows that memory retention drops steeply soon after learning, unless the information is reviewed at strategic intervals.

**Spaced Repetition** is a learning technique that counters the forgetting curve by scheduling reviews just before you are likely to forget. Neuroscience research shows that repeated, spaced retrieval strengthens neural connections, making memories more durable and easier to recall.

**The Testing Effect** is another powerful principle: actively recalling information (testing yourself) is far more effective for long-term retention than passive review. Studies in cognitive psychology and neuroscience demonstrate that retrieval practice not only reinforces memory but also improves the ability to apply knowledge in new situations.

**BetterLearn** combines these principles‚Äîspaced repetition and active recall‚Äîusing AI to generate personalized quizzes and flashcards, helping you learn more efficiently and remember longer.
